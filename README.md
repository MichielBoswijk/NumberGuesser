  Number Guessing Game Mobile Application

  This app generates a (speudo)random number between 1 and 1000 (endpoints included).
  The user tries to guess the number. Each time the user makes a guess, the app
  gives a hint saying whether the secret number is higher or lower than the input until the right number is guessed.
